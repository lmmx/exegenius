## This page

Concept: Controlled shifts and rational scalings
Gloss: Updating a target address field by an offset computed from earlier control fields, or multiplying it by a unit, in time linear in the array volume.
## Where the argument relies on this page

- Bit variant: two disjoint address chunks of $u$ bits can be interchanged on a fixed number of tapes in $O(Vu^\tau)$ time, $\tau=1-2^{-50}$, although the intermediate steps form XOR combinations of data. (on [Fast address-chunk interchange](address-interchange.md))
- For a rational $m\times m$ matrix $A$ of rank $a$ and fields over $\mathbb Z/q^b\mathbb Z$, the shear $(H,D)\mapsto(H+AD,D)$ can be performed with exactly $a$ interchanges of pairs of $b$-digit fields and $O(V)$ further work. (on [Matrix shear by triangular factorization](matrix-shear.md))
- Selected bits of two chunks can be XORed (with a third chunk as restored scratch) by eight cyclic shifts of whole chunk ranges plus a repair of an explicitly bounded exceptional set of addresses, in time $O(V(L^\tau+1)+MA_{\rm rect}^3+\delta_{\rm bad}MA_{\rm rect}(R+A_{\rm rect}))$. (on [Packed selected-bit addition](packed-bit-addition.md))
- The Chinese-remainder map $\Phi:\mathbb C[x]/(x^S-1)\to\mathbb C[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_i^{s_i}-1)$, $x\mapsto\prod_ix_i^{\mu_i}$, is an isomorphism preserving cyclic convolution, and it (with its inverse and padding) is implemented by triangular controlled shifts in $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ time. (on [Chinese-remainder address map](crt-map.md))
