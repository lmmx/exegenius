## This page

Concept: Multidimensional transforms
Gloss: A transform over several axes at once, the tensor product of one-dimensional transforms, applied to an array one axis at a time.
## Where the argument relies on this page

- Synthetic transforms over $\mathcal R_r$ on $d-1$ axes of lengths $t_i\in\{2^{\ell-1},2^\ell\}$ with outputs kept in a retained layout $LB$ cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ with error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$. (on [Tape layout for synthetic transforms](transform-layout.md))
- The Fourier transforms of pairwise coprime prime lengths $s_i$ that the integer product needs are computed through power-of-two lengths $t_i$ by Gaussian resampling and Bluestein chirps, with the source and target coordinate permutations left inside the transform identities, so that none is executed as a sort. (on [Retained permutation cancellation](retained-permutations.md))
- For coprime $s<t$ with $\theta=t/s-1>p/\alpha^4$ and permutations $(P_su)_j=u_{tj}$, $(P_tv)_k=v_{-sk}$ there are linear contractions $A$, $B_0$ with $P_sF_s=2^{2\alpha^2}B_0P_tF_tA$, computed with error less than $p^2$ in time $O(tp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ without executing $P_s$ or $P_t$. (on [Gaussian resampling](gaussian-resampling.md))
- Applied one coordinate line at a time to a padded box of $T=\prod_it_i$ entries, with $\gamma=2d\alpha^2$, $R F_{\boldsymbol s}=2^\gamma\mathcal B_0QF_{\boldsymbol t}\mathcal A$, both $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B_0$ are contractions with error less than $dp^2$, computed in $O(dTp^{3/2+\delta}\alpha)$ plus $O(Tp\,d^2(1+\ell^\tau))$ for exposing lines.
