Concept: Synthetic polynomial transform
Gloss: A transform over the ring modulo y^r + 1 whose roots of unity are powers of y, so every twiddle multiplication is a signed shift of a coefficient list.
Also called: polynomial transform
## Where the argument relies on this page

- Synthetic transforms over $\mathcal R_r$ on $d-1$ axes of lengths $t_i\in\{2^{\ell-1},2^\ell\}$ with outputs kept in a retained layout $LB$ cost $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}])$ with error less than $\sqrt2\ell\,2^{-p}$. (on [Tape layout for synthetic transforms](transform-layout.md))
- The synthetic transform $F_t^-$ over $\mathcal R_r=\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$, with roots of unity $\omega_t=y^{2r/t}$, is computed by decimation in frequency with outputs written in bit-reversed order, $B_tF_t^-$; the pointwise product keeps this order and the reverse procedure computes $F_t^+B_t^{-1}$, so no reordering is executed. (on [Retained frequency order](frequency-order.md))
- Normalized cyclic convolution over the polynomial ring $\mathbb C[y]/(y^r+1)$ on the remaining $d-1$ axes is computed from two forward synthetic transforms in retained order, $M$ pointwise polynomial products and the opposite transform, in $O(Tp[dK+pK^{\tau-1}+\ell d^{\lambda'}+\log(rp)])$ time with error less than $\sqrt2\,M(3\ell+1)2^{-p}$. (on [Convolution from the retained transform layout](ring-convolution.md))
